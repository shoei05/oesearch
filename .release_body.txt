## What's Changed
- Add IME guard toggle in Options (default ON)
- Prevent Enter-submission during Japanese IME composition on openevidence.com textareas/inputs/contenteditable
- Respect live option changes without reload
- Update tester notes and options copy
- Bump version to 1.0.3 and refine pack script

## Notes
- The IME guard only affects trusted user events; extension-simulated submits are not blocked.
- You can disable it in Options if a site provides its own robust handling.
